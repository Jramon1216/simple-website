# Project Synopsis
------------

This project was made for the first step of an interview process for a job I applied for. It is the front end of a full stack project meant to be a mock-up of a messaging service using 2 Django endpoints, this project uses axios and async-await promises to talk to the back end and retrieve messages for the user. The project had a 5-day time constraint hence the lack of features, streamlining of data retrieval, and overall vulnerability. Over time I intend to continue adding to this project to make it more secure.


Future Project Plans/Features:
* ~~Character limit for messages to comply with database constraints~~
* Set up a character counter so the user can know when they are coming up on the imposed limit
* Profanity filter
* Add more error handling and components to display error messages on screen
* Styling for mobile devices
* Hide API URLs
* Add filters to avoid personal info being sent as a message to the public database
